  <h3>About Me</h3>
  <p>Hello, my name is Kan. And I write this simple page for the Software Engineer
     Interview of Uber.</p>
  <p>I am working in a small <a href="http://mixbit.com/" target="_blank">startup</a> as a full stack web developer. I have worked on several different projects during my one and half years in this company. I have written Ruby for a web magazine application. I was also working on a project based on MongoDB and Redis to generate music magazines automatically. In the most recent project, I helped create an Android app from ground up and write the first front-end test framework for our website.</p>
  <p>I joined this company after I graduated from Dartmouth College. I have been intern in Google (Google Search iOS App), Yelp (Android App + Python API), Microsoft (Mobile App) and another China based startup when I was in school. I am used to the startup lifestyle and love the idea of quickly iterating a product.</p>
  <p>Uber is definitely one of the most exciting products I have heard of in recent years. Despite its exponential growth, I am impressed by its vision that building a network of drivers to deliver everything, everywhere. As an engineer, rapid growth and challenge engineering problems are the most attractive parts of a job.</p>
  <p>Hope you like my work of <a href="http://inch.im/">San Francisco Movie Map</a>, I am looking forward to hearing from you.</p>
  <p>- Kan</p>
